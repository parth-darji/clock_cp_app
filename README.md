# Clock Custom Painter App

This Flutter project implements a custom clock using the `CustomPainter` class. The clock updates in real-time and provides a seamless user experience with Flutter's rich UI capabilities. The app also integrates `sqflite` for local database storage, `provider` for state management, and `flutter_local_notifications` to send notifications at specific times.
